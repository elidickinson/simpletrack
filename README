Overview
--------

A very simple javascript-based web visitor behavioral tracking system. It keeps a running log of the last
few pages viewed by the visitor (up to max 1kb of data). No server overhead at all since all the data is
saved in the user's cookie.

Default cookie expiration is one week. Default cookie name is "_st"

Released under GPLv3.

Usage
------

On each page:

<script type="text/javascript" src="st.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript">
   (new simpletrack()).trackPage()
</script>


And then to stuff the data into a hidden form field:

<input type="hidden" name="pages_viewed" id="pages_viewed" value=""/>

<script  type="text/javascript">
   document.getElementById('pages_viewed').value = st_prettyPrint();
</script>
